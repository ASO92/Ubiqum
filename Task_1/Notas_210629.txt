Blackwell Electronics’ CTO Danielle Sherman has asked you to use data mining methods to explore the customer transaction data collected from recent online and in-store sales to infer any insights and conclusions about customer purchasing behavior, specifically:

Do customers in different regions spend more per transaction? Which regions spend the most/least?
Is there a relationship between the number of items purchased and amount spent?
