----FUTURE---
- HAcer un Git y subir todo a GIT

- Send a pdf copy of the jupiter notebook.
- boxplot
- scattter plots to investigate the relationship between varaibles. You will see the relationship that exists

- Why distribution is needed and important -> To balance data

you should think abount it. You can colour any variable.
If we look at the amounts or the dataset. Can we just think of smaller units? Distint units in the datasate. In our data set. We have the same online/onstore
But if we dig, in relation with regions. We have regions that do not buy online and others that do so
In north they do not buy online. Thinking . Point it out. Why? -> Maybe in south there are no shops
    - Dig a litter deeper with the distribution.
    - There are some parts that are not necessarily that contribute in the same way.
    - turnover?
Probably i none region, where the online store is missing, maybe they are talking of all the islands of the EEUU. -> Do not consider too much the regions as fixed places. - Consider the timeframe
- A competitor made a offer to Blackwell
- Keep looking at the distribution. Example distribution of the amounts
- Dont feel worry of makin mistakes.
- Play around and ask yourself why this is this.
- Look at the shape, whis is this like this. 
- LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION. Highly recommend to do it. This is a preselection. 
- Distribution of different varaibles. ¿Cómo se hace una distribution?
- HEatmap but its not really adding anything.
- Use the visualizatio to look at the data



NOTAS 07/07/2021
- Treat the outliers. Need to say , these many points are considered outliers, but I decided to keep/drop
- Put title, index, separate the sections
- Try to explain what Im doing. Not mention the POA, ni el curso.
- CUIDADO CON EXPLICAR MAL Y METER CAUSATION Y CORRELATION!!!
- FOR CORRELATION YOU SEE SCATTERPLOTS. You can see with the two varaibles. If the age grows, what happens to the amount.
- Have a look to the scatterplots and use the correlation coefficient.
- Its gonna be a bit of time
- If we use the heat map.
- Explain what we are doing. Dont get scare that our work is too simple. 
- see outliers by regions. box plot. It is also a matter of personal test. 
- The way to remove outliers depends on me, there is not a fixed rule to keep it or leave it.
- Scatter plots of vertical 

NOTAS 08/07/2021
- One thing to do. In region column, check unique values. Need to make sure that there are only, 1,2,3,4. CANT be 5. Null values
- Check all the values on the column. 
- Introduction: talk abount the contest. Info ablut the company and the data. How many rows does it have. It does not change the quality o my work but it give me the habit to do it. Just do it. 
- Outliers in step 3. 
- Look each single column. 
- We need to be supported by tools to say. Not make a statement, based on the sample. We are just at the beginning. The way you are expressing it may sound not correct.
